Application 1:Assume that the college takes very few transfer students and has most of its students stay for at least one year. (Hints: no frequent insertion and deletion operations). And the maximum student number is given. But it does require a lot of search operations based on student ages. Please note that your search functions may return multiple records when only a student age is given. In addition, the college often requires calculating the largest age gap among its students. The major interfaces provided by your code should include createDataSet, destroyDataSet, searchAge, insertion, deletion, maxAgeGap
