Application 3:Assume a new college that is expanding frequently and dramatically on its student amount. This leads to two consequences. First, accurately estimating the total number of students is extremely difficult. Second, frequent insertions and deletions are performed. In addition, the college frequently requires calculating the largest age gap among its students. Assume that search operations are not performed frequently. Your implementation has to support searches on either student ID or age. The major interfaces provided by your code should include createDataSet, destroyDataSet, searchAge, searchID, insertion, deletion, maxAgeGap
