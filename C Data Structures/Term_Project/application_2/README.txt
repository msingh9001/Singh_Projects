Application 2:Assume that the college takes very few transfer students and has most of its students stay for at least one year (Hints: no frequent insertion and deletion operations). And the maximum student number is given. But it does require a lot of search operations. Specifically, all of the searches are based on student IDs. The major interfaces provided by your code should include createDataSet, destroyDataSet, searchID, insertion, deletion.
