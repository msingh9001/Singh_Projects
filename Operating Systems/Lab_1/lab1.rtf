\f0\fs24 \cf0 Part 1 displays the Home, User, Path, and Current Directory locations. It then displays the current user logged in and how many users are logged in. If the current user is salagtash, then it continues to ask the dimensions for rectangle calculation. However, since I am not salagtash, it says checked who logged in and exits. For part 2, I remove the exit so it continues to the calculations for the rectangle and circle. I read in length, width, and radius from the user input. Then, Basic Calculator is used to compute float multiplication for the area of the circle and the results for the rectangle and circle are displayed. The user is asked if they want to input more values for calculations and exits when they respond no.}
