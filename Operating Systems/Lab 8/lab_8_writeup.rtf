\f0\fs24 \cf0 Other than the 50 page test ran for the demo, I used 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500. For all the algorithms, the hit rate scales at a very similar rate. The graph shows the lines as almost identical with very little visible difference. As we learned in class, the more pages there are, the higher the hit rate and that is seen in the results as the hit rate goes up with increasing pages.}
